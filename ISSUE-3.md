# Issue #3: LLM-Initiated Rule Improvement Suggestions

**Description**

When an LLM encounters a situation where the existing rules are unclear, contradictory, or difficult to follow, it should be empowered to suggest improvements. This task is to add a rule that explicitly instructs LLMs to open an issue in the `cursor_rules` repository with their suggestions.

**Acceptance Criteria**

- The `MANDATORY-RULES.md` file is updated with a new rule that instructs LLMs to open an issue in the `cursor_rules` repository when they have a problem following the rules.
- The new rule should be placed in a logical and visible location within the document.
- The changes are documented and follow all existing repository rules.

**Resolution**

This issue has been addressed. The `MANDATORY-RULES.md` file has been updated with the new "LLM RULE IMPROVEMENT PROCESS" rule. These changes were consolidated and merged into the `preview` branch as part of the work for Issue #6.

**Status: CLOSED**
