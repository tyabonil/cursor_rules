# Cursor Rules Repository

> 🤖 **Optimized for LLM consumption** - Comprehensive agentic coding rules for AI-driven development

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository contains **hierarchical coding rules** designed for Large Language Models (LLMs) to follow when working on software development projects. The rules ensure security, workflow integrity, quality gates, and development best practices.

## 📁 Repository Structure

### **Core Files (LLM-Optimized)**
- **`MANDATORY-RULES.md`** - Complete rule hierarchy (Levels 1-4)
- **`core-workspace-rules.md`** - Project workspace patterns
- **`environment-variables-management.md`** - Environment handling
- **`copy-paste-templates/ESSENTIAL-CURSORRULES.md`** - Quick reference
- **`workflow/`** - Branch management and file patterns
- **`github/`** - GitHub API integration rules

## 🚀 Usage

### **For AI/LLM Assistants:**
1. Always start by reviewing `MANDATORY-RULES.md`
2. Follow the 4-level hierarchy: Security → Workflow → Quality → Patterns
3. Use enforcement checklists before/after every action
4. Reference specific rule files for detailed guidance

### **For Human Developers:**
1. This repository is optimized for AI consumption
2. Humans can review rules for understanding AI behavior
3. All rules apply to human developers as well
4. Issues and PRs follow standard GitHub workflow

## 📊 Token Efficiency

- **Optimized size**: ~40KB total for fast LLM processing
- **No redundancy**: Single source of truth for each rule type
- **Hierarchical priority**: Most critical rules first
- **Actionable focus**: Every rule provides specific guidance

## 🛡️ Rule Hierarchy

1. **Level 1**: Security & Safety (Non-negotiable)
2. **Level 2**: Workflow Integrity (Mandatory) 
3. **Level 3**: Quality Gates (Mandatory)
4. **Level 4**: Development Patterns (Strongly Recommended)
