# Quick Reference Guide

## ðŸš¨ Always Applied Rules (Copy to .cursorrules)

```markdown
# ALWAYS ON EVERY PROMPT
- Always refer to github rules on every git/github action
- Review PROJECT_CONTEXT.md if it exists, create if it doesn't
- Never add stubbing/fake data to dev or prod environments
- Never overwrite .env files
- **AUTONOMOUSLY create PRs to cursor_rules for new generally-applicable rules**

# GITHUB WORKFLOW
- **ALWAYS use MCP GitHub API tools (mcp_github_*) instead of terminal git**
- Never merge into main/master - use preview branch
- Create branch referencing issue for each change
- Create issues for all new work
- 100% test coverage required

# CODING STANDARDS  
- Prefer simple solutions
- Avoid code duplication
- Files â‰¤200-300 lines
- Environment-aware (dev/test/prod)
- Update PROJECT_CONTEXT.md for changes
```

## âš¡ Emergency Protocols

### **Blocked by Dependencies**
1. Create blocker issue immediately
2. Break into smaller, non-dependent pieces
3. Work on parallel tracks
4. Document dependency resolution timeline

### **Repository Sync Issues**
1. Create new issue for any untracked work
2. Create new branch from current state
3. Clean up file tracking (.gitignore updates)
4. Commit with proper issue reference

### **Large Features**
1. If >7 days estimated, break down immediately
2. Create epic with sub-issues
3. Each sub-issue must be independently buildable
4. Sequential dependencies only when absolutely necessary
