```
fix: address bot analysis issues for production code

- Wrap console statements in environment checks in check-deps.js
- Fix unquoted variable in goal-alignment-check.sh shell script
- Use proper loop handling for file lists to handle spaces correctly

These changes ensure production builds are cleaner while maintaining
debugging capabilities in development environments.
