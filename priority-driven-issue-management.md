# Priority-Driven, Dependency-Aware Issue Management Process

**Based on real-world implementation experience in enterprise AI platform development**

## Problem Statement

Traditional issue management often leads to:
- Large, overwhelming issues that block progress for weeks
- Unclear dependencies causing work to be done in wrong order
- Inability to build/test incrementally
- Team members blocked waiting for prerequisites
- Difficulty measuring progress and velocity

## The Priority-Driven Solution

### **ðŸŽ¯ Priority Classification System**

| Priority | Description | Timeline | Dependencies |
|----------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| **P0-BLOCKER** | Blocks ALL other work | <7 days | None - immediate |
| **P0-CRITICAL** | Core platform functionality | <14 days | After P0-BLOCKER |
| **P1-HIGH** | Important features | <21 days | After P0s |
| **P2-MEDIUM** | Nice-to-have features | <30 days | After P1s |
| **P3-LOW** | Future enhancements | Backlog | After P2s |

### **ðŸ”„ Issue Breakdown Rules**

1. **Maximum Size**: No issue should take >7 days for one person
2. **Buildable Increments**: Each issue must result in a buildable, testable state
3. **Clear Dependencies**: Map all blocking relationships upfront
4. **Parallel Streams**: Identify work that can happen simultaneously

## Implementation Process

### **Phase 1: Issue Assessment**

```markdown
## Large Issue Breakdown Template

### Original Issue: [Title] (Estimated: X weeks)

**Break into:**
- **Day 1-2**: [Specific deliverable] (P0-BLOCKER)
- **Day 3-4**: [Specific deliverable] (P0-CRITICAL) 
- **Day 5-7**: [Specific deliverable] (P1-HIGH)
- **Day 8+**: [Additional increments] (P2+)

**Dependency Chain:**
- Issue A â†’ Issue B â†’ Issue C
- Issue D (parallel to A,B,C)
- Issue E (depends on B,D)
```

### **Phase 2: Dependency Mapping**

Create visual dependency graphs:
```
[Infrastructure] â†’ [Core Features] â†’ [UI Polish]
       â†“                â†“              â†“
[Testing Setup] â†’ [Integration] â†’ [Documentation]
```

### **Phase 3: Sequential Execution**

1. **Start with P0-BLOCKERS** - Must complete before anything else
2. **Execute in dependency order** - Never start B if A blocks it
3. **Validate builds after each issue** - Ensure continuous functionality
4. **Create parallel streams** where possible

## Real-World Example: ODNEP Platform

### **Original Problem:**
- Issue #32: "Infrastructure Setup" (estimated 2-3 weeks)
- Blocked ALL development work
- Team couldn't start any features

### **Solution Applied:**
```
Issue #32 (Infrastructure) â†’ Broken into:
â”œâ”€â”€ Issue #42: Day 1 - Monorepo structure (2 days)
â”œâ”€â”€ Issue #43: Day 2 - Next.js 14 platform (2 days)  
â”œâ”€â”€ Issue #44: Day 3 - React overlay engine (2 days)
â”œâ”€â”€ Issue #45: Day 4 - Shared packages (2 days) 
â””â”€â”€ Issue #46: Day 5 - Environment config (1 day)

Result: Infrastructure "complete" was discovered to already exist!
Saved 2-3 weeks by proper assessment.
```

### **Follow-up Sequential Execution:**
```
âœ… Issues #42-46 (Infrastructure) â†’ Complete
âœ… Issue #47 (JavaScript Snippet) â†’ Complete  
ðŸ“‹ Issue #39 (Test Coverage Rules) â†’ Next
ðŸ“‹ Issue #4 (WebSocket Planning) â†’ After #39
```

## Mandatory Rules

### **ðŸš¨ ALWAYS OBEY THESE RULES**

1. **No issue >7 days** - Break it down further
2. **Build after every issue** - Validate continuous functionality  
3. **Test coverage required** - 100% for new code
4. **Dependencies mapped upfront** - No surprises
5. **Blocked issues get blocking sub-issues** - Create work for the blocker
6. **Sequential execution** - Finish A before starting B if B depends on A
7. **Create parallel streams** - Maximize team velocity

### **ðŸ”§ When Blocked:**

```markdown
## Blocking Issue Template

**I am blocked by:** [Specific dependency]
**Blocking issue created:** #[number]
**Assigned to:** [Person who can unblock]
**Moving to next sequential issue:** #[number]
**Parallel work available:** [List alternatives]
```

## Tooling and Implementation

### **GitHub Integration**

```yaml
# .github/issue_template.md
## Priority Assessment
- [ ] P0-BLOCKER (blocks everything)
- [ ] P0-CRITICAL (core functionality)  
- [ ] P1-HIGH (important feature)
- [ ] P2-MEDIUM (nice to have)
- [ ] P3-LOW (future enhancement)

## Dependency Check
- [ ] No dependencies (can start immediately)
- [ ] Depends on: #[issue numbers]
- [ ] Blocks: #[issue numbers]
- [ ] Can be done in parallel with: #[issue numbers]

## Size Validation
- [ ] Estimated completion: â‰¤7 days
- [ ] Results in buildable increment
- [ ] Has clear acceptance criteria
- [ ] Includes test coverage plan
```

### **Issue Labels**

- `priority/p0-blocker` - Red, urgent
- `priority/p0-critical` - Orange  
- `priority/p1-high` - Yellow
- `priority/p2-medium` - Blue
- `priority/p3-low` - Gray
- `depends-on/issue-X` - Dependency tracking
- `blocks/issue-X` - Blocking relationship

## Success Metrics

### **Before Implementation:**
- Issues taking 2-4 weeks to complete
- Frequent blocking and waiting
- Difficulty measuring progress
- Build failures and integration problems

### **After Implementation:**
- All issues complete in â‰¤7 days
- Clear dependency chains
- Parallel development streams
- Continuous builds and testing
- Predictable delivery timelines

## Copy-Paste Ready Rules

### **For .cursorrules:**

```markdown
# Priority-Driven Issue Management ALWAYS OBEY THESE RULES
- Break issues into â‰¤7 day increments that result in buildable states
- Map dependencies upfront and execute in dependency order
- Create parallel work streams wherever possible
- Build and test after every completed issue
- When blocked, create blocking issues and move to next sequential work
- No exceptions to 100% test coverage for new code
- Use P0-BLOCKER â†’ P0-CRITICAL â†’ P1-HIGH â†’ P2-MEDIUM â†’ P3-LOW prioritization
```

### **For Team Workflows:**

```markdown
# Daily Standup Questions
1. What did I complete yesterday? (issue #)
2. What am I working on today? (issue #, priority)
3. What is blocking me? (create blocking issue if needed)
4. What parallel work can I do if blocked?
5. Did yesterday's work result in a successful build?
```

## Results from Real Implementation

**ODNEP Platform Case Study:**
- **32 open issues** â†’ Organized into priority streams
- **3 week infrastructure estimate** â†’ Discovered already complete in 2 hours
- **Issue #47 (JavaScript Snippet)** â†’ Completed in 4 hours with 100% test coverage
- **Unblocked ALL customer integration work** within first day

**This process transforms overwhelming backlogs into manageable, sequential development streams that maintain continuous progress and build stability.**
