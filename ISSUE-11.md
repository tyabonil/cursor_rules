# Issue #11: Introduce PR Remediation and Error-Handling Protocol

**Description**

I have repeatedly failed to correctly handle PRs, especially when they have violations or merge conflicts. This indicates a gap in the rules for handling such situations. This issue tracks the work to create a clear, step-by-step protocol for what to do when a PR is blocked or has errors.

**Acceptance Criteria**

- A new "PR REMEDIATION PROTOCOL" is added to `MANDATORY-RULES.md`.
- The protocol will include steps for:
    - What to do when a PR has violations.
    - How to handle merge conflicts.
    - The correct way to update a PR with fixes.
    - When to close and when to edit a PR.
- The `RULES-LLM-OPTIMIZED.md` file is updated by running the build script.
- The changes are tested and follow all existing repository rules.
