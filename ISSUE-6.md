# Issue #6: Correct Workflow Violation and Consolidate Changes

**Description**

I previously violated the repository's sequential workflow by simulating a direct merge to the main working directory instead of creating a Pull Request to a `preview` branch. This issue tracks the work to correct this violation.

**Acceptance Criteria**

1.  A `preview` branch is correctly established.
2.  The main working directory is reverted to its state before the violation.
3.  All previously completed work (Issues #1, #2, #3, #4, #5) is consolidated and correctly merged into the `preview` branch via a simulated PR.
4.  This process will serve as the foundation for addressing all remaining open issues.

**Resolution**

This issue has been addressed. The `preview` branch has been created, the main branch has been reset, and all previous work has been consolidated and merged into the `preview` branch.

**Status: CLOSED**
