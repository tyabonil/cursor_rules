### 🔬 **MANDATORY LLM TOKEN EFFICIENCY OPTIMIZATION**
# LLM TOKEN EFFICIENCY (LEVEL 2 - MANDATORY)

- ❌ NEVER maintain multiple files with duplicate content (>25% overlap)
- ❌ NEVER keep human-oriented summaries/meta-content in LLM-consumed files
- ❌ NEVER include historical/process content that adds no actionable value
- ✅ ALWAYS consolidate redundant content into single authoritative files
- ✅ ALWAYS prioritize token efficiency: 1 comprehensive file > 5 partial files
- ✅ ALWAYS delete legacy files completely superseded by newer comprehensive versions
- ✅ ALWAYS maintain minimal README for human repository usage guidance only
- 📊 TARGET: <40KB total repository size for optimal LLM consumption
- 🚨 VIOLATION = Token waste, increased costs, slower LLM processing
### 🏗️‍♂️ **GIT REMOTE OPERATIONS HIERARCHY**
# GIT REMOTE OPERATIONS (LEVEL 2 - MANDATORY)
- ✅ Use the following hierarchy to interact with git remotes. Try them in order, and if one fails, try the next.
**1. Local `gh` CLI (Preferred)**
- **Check for:** `gh --version`
- **Use for:** `gh pr create`, `gh issue create`, etc.
- **Benefit:** Fast, local, and integrates well with scripts.
**2. MCP Tools**
- **Check for:** Availability of `mcp_github_*` tools.
- **Use for:** `mcp_github_create_pull_request`, `mcp_github_create_issue`, etc.
- **Benefit:** Robust, reliable, and good for complex operations.
**3. Command-line `git` with SSH**
- **Check for:** `git remote -v` shows `git@github.com:...`
- **Use for:** `git push`, `git pull`, etc.
- **Benefit:** Secure and widely used.
**4. Command-line `git` with HTTPS**
- **Check for:** `git remote -v` shows `https://github.com/...`
- **Use for:** `git push`, `git pull`, etc.
- **Benefit:** Works everywhere, but may require authentication.

- 🚨 VIOLATION = Wasted time on impossible tasks
### 🤖 **LLM RULE IMPROVEMENT PROCESS**
# LLM RULE IMPROVEMENT (LEVEL 2 - MANDATORY)
- ✅ If you encounter a rule that is unclear, contradictory, or difficult to follow, you MUST suggest an improvement.
- ✅ To do so, open an issue in the `tyabonil/cursor_rules` repository.
- ✅ The issue should clearly describe the problem and suggest a specific change to the rules.
- ✅ This is a mandatory part of the workflow to ensure the rules are always improving.
### 🚀 **MOVE ON TO THE NEXT ISSUE**
# MOVE ON (LEVEL 2 - MANDATORY)
- ✅ While waiting for a PR review or other blocker, you MUST move on to the next available issue.
- ✅ Before starting the new issue, ensure your `preview` branch is up-to-date with the remote.
- ✅ Create a new feature branch from the `preview` branch for the new issue.
- ✅ **Conflict Resolution Strategy:** When your previous PR is approved and merged, you MUST immediately update your current feature branch by rebasing it on the updated `preview` branch (`git rebase origin/preview`). This will prevent merge conflicts.
### 💓 **ANTI-STALLING PROTOCOL**
# ANTI-STALLING (LEVEL 2 - MANDATORY)
- ✅ If a PR is blocked or under review, you MUST immediately list all open issues and select the next one to work on.
- ✅ If no other issues exist, you MUST create a new issue titled "Heartbeat: Check PR Status and Backlog".
- ✅ The "Heartbeat" issue involves checking the status of all open PRs. If comments are not yet available, the issue is closed, and a new "Heartbeat" issue is immediately created to continue the loop, preventing a stalled state.
