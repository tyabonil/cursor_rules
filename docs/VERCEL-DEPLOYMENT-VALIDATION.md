# üöÄ Vercel Deployment Validation

## Overview

The MANDATORY Rules system now includes comprehensive Vercel deployment failure detection and reporting. This enhancement helps developers identify and resolve deployment issues before merging PRs, preventing stale PRs with hidden build failures.

## Features

### üîç **Automatic Detection**
- **Status Check Integration**: Monitors both legacy GitHub Status API and modern Checks API
- **Vercel-Specific Patterns**: Detects various Vercel deployment contexts:
  - `Vercel` (main deployment check)
  - `Vercel Build` (build process check)
  - `Vercel Preview` (preview deployment)
  - Generic `deployment` contexts

### üìä **Comprehensive Reporting**
- **Failure Analysis**: Detailed breakdown of failed deployments
- **Deployment URLs**: Direct links to Vercel deployment logs
- **Actionable Guidance**: Step-by-step troubleshooting instructions
- **Multiple States**: Handles failure, error, cancelled, pending, and in-progress states

### üõ†Ô∏è **Troubleshooting Support**
Provides automated guidance for common Vercel issues:
- Build errors (TypeScript, missing dependencies)
- Environment variable configuration
- Prisma schema problems
- Memory and timeout issues

## Implementation

### Rule Engine Integration

The enhancement is integrated into **Level 2: Workflow Integrity** checks:

```javascript
// Level 2 workflow now includes Vercel deployment validation
async checkLevel2Workflow(prData, files, commits, githubClient) {
  // ... existing checks ...
  
  // Check Vercel deployment status
  const vercelViolations = await this.checkVercelDeploymentStatus(prData, githubClient);
  violations.push(...vercelViolations);
  
  return violations;
}
```

### GitHub API Integration

New methods added to `GitHubClient`:

#### `getStatusChecks()`
- Fetches both legacy Status API and modern Checks API results
- Provides comprehensive view of all PR status checks

#### `checkVercelDeploymentStatus()`
- Filters status checks for Vercel-related contexts
- Analyzes deployment states and provides detailed reporting
- Returns structured data about deployment status

### Violation Types

#### `DEP-1: VERCEL DEPLOYMENT VALIDATION`
- **Level**: 2 (Workflow Integrity)
- **Severity**: WARNING
- **Trigger**: Failed Vercel deployments detected
- **Action**: Fix deployment issues before merge

#### `DEP-2: VERCEL DEPLOYMENT PENDING`  
- **Level**: 2 (Workflow Integrity)
- **Severity**: INFO
- **Trigger**: Vercel deployments still in progress
- **Action**: Wait for deployment completion

## Usage Examples

### Successful Deployment
When no Vercel issues are detected:
```
### ‚úÖ **Level 2: Workflow Integrity**
- ‚úÖ Issue reference found
- ‚úÖ Branch naming compliant
- ‚úÖ MCP GitHub API usage detected
- ‚úÖ TOKEN efficiency maintained
- ‚úÖ Deployment status verified
```

### Failed Deployment
When Vercel deployment fails:
```
#### ‚ö° **DEP-1: VERCEL DEPLOYMENT VALIDATION**
- **Issue**: üöÄ Vercel deployment failed (1 failure)
- **Details**: Vercel deployment must succeed before merging to ensure the application builds correctly.
- **Action Required**: Fix deployment issues before proceeding with merge
- **Fix**: Run local build and address deployment errors
- **Evidence**: ‚ùå Vercel Build: failure - Build failed: TypeScript compilation error
- **Deployment URLs**: [View](https://vercel.com/project/deployment/abc123)

**Troubleshooting Guide:**
üîß **Common Vercel deployment issues:**
‚Ä¢ Build errors (TypeScript, missing dependencies)
‚Ä¢ Environment variable issues
‚Ä¢ Prisma schema problems
‚Ä¢ Memory or timeout issues

üõ†Ô∏è **Debug steps:**
1. Run `npm run build` locally to identify build errors
2. Check Vercel deployment logs for detailed error messages
3. Verify environment variables match Vercel settings
4. Ensure all dependencies are properly installed

üîó **Deployment URLs:**
‚Ä¢ [View deployment](https://vercel.com/project/deployment/abc123)
```

## Benefits

### üö´ **Prevents Issues**
- **Stale PRs**: No more PRs sitting with hidden deployment failures
- **Broken Deployments**: Catch build issues before they reach main
- **Developer Confusion**: Clear visibility into deployment status

### ‚ö° **Faster Feedback**
- **Immediate Detection**: Issues identified in PR checks
- **Actionable Guidance**: Specific steps to resolve problems
- **Direct Links**: Quick access to deployment logs

### üîß **Better Developer Experience**
- **Optional Integration**: Works whether or not project uses Vercel
- **Non-Blocking**: Deployment checks don't prevent legitimate merges
- **Comprehensive**: Covers multiple deployment scenarios

## Technical Details

### Detection Logic

1. **API Calls**: Fetches status checks using both GitHub APIs
2. **Pattern Matching**: Identifies Vercel-related checks by name/context
3. **State Analysis**: Categorizes checks as failed, pending, or successful
4. **URL Extraction**: Collects deployment URLs for easy access

### Error Handling

- **Graceful Degradation**: API failures don't block rule checking
- **Optional Feature**: Missing Vercel checks don't create violations
- **Logging**: Comprehensive console output for debugging

### Performance

- **Efficient API Usage**: Single API call fetches all status checks
- **Minimal Overhead**: Only runs when status checks exist
- **Cached Results**: GitHub API provides efficient caching

## Configuration

### Repository Requirements

**None** - The feature works automatically for any repository with Vercel deployments.

### Environment Variables

**None required** - Uses existing GitHub token permissions.

### Optional Customization

Projects can customize detection patterns by modifying the `checkVercelDeploymentStatus` method to include project-specific deployment contexts.

## Compatibility

### Vercel Integration Types
- ‚úÖ **Vercel GitHub App**: Fully supported
- ‚úÖ **Vercel CLI Deployments**: Supported via status API
- ‚úÖ **Custom Vercel Workflows**: Supported if they set GitHub status

### GitHub Features
- ‚úÖ **Status API (Legacy)**: Full support
- ‚úÖ **Checks API (Modern)**: Full support
- ‚úÖ **Mixed Environments**: Handles both simultaneously

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "No Vercel checks detected"
- **Cause**: Repository doesn't use Vercel or hasn't set up GitHub integration
- **Solution**: This is normal - the feature is optional

#### "Failed to fetch status checks"
- **Cause**: GitHub API permissions or rate limiting
- **Solution**: Check token permissions and wait for rate limit reset

#### "Deployment URL not working"
- **Cause**: Vercel deployment may be private or expired
- **Solution**: Access deployment through Vercel dashboard directly

### Debug Information

The system provides comprehensive logging:
```
üöÄ Checking Vercel deployment status...
üîç Fetching status checks for PR #123...
‚úÖ Found 3 status checks
‚úÖ Vercel check analysis: hasVercel=true, total=2, failed=1, pending=0
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Vercel CLI Integration**: Direct deployment log fetching
- **Performance Metrics**: Track deployment speed and success rates
- **Custom Patterns**: Configurable deployment context detection

### Extensibility
The framework can be extended to support other deployment platforms:
- Netlify
- AWS Amplify
- Azure Static Web Apps
- Railway
- Render
