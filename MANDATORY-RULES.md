- ❌ NEVER use terminal for remote operations (push, remote branch creation, PR creation)
- 🚨 FAILURE = Remote operations via terminal cause workflow failures
```

### 🔍 **MANDATORY GITHUB WORKFLOW VALIDATION**
```markdown
# GITHUB WORKFLOW VALIDATION (LEVEL 2 - MANDATORY)
**BEFORE every git action:**
- [ ] Review MANDATORY-RULES.md GitHub workflow section
- [ ] Validate issue exists for this work
- [ ] Confirm using correct branch (never main/master directly)
- [ ] Verify using appropriate MCP GitHub API tools
- [ ] Check: Is this the right workflow step (Issue → Branch → PR → Merge)?

**AFTER every git action:**
- [ ] Verify no workflow violations occurred
- [ ] Confirm proper Issue → Branch → PR → Merge sequence followed
- [ ] Check: Did I use correct MCP API tools vs terminal commands?
- [ ] Document any violations immediately for learning
- [ ] Update memory with lessons learned if violations found

- 🚨 VIOLATION = Complete workflow integrity failure - document and prevent recurrence
```

```

### 🔄 **POST-MERGE WORKFLOW ACTIONS**
```markdown
# POST-MERGE MANDATORY ACTIONS (LEVEL 2 - MANDATORY)
- ✅ ALWAYS recheck related issues after successful PR merge to preview
- ✅ ALWAYS comment on issues with completion status and close if fully resolved
- ✅ ALWAYS ensure local main and preview branches are 100% aligned with remote
- ✅ ALWAYS use MCP GitHub API for remote operations:

  - Use mcp_github_list_commits to check synchronization status
- ✅ ALWAYS use terminal for local operations:
  - git checkout main (local branch switch)
  - git checkout preview (local branch switch)
  - git status (verify clean working directory)
  - git pull origin main (local sync from remote)
  - git pull origin preview (local sync from remote)
