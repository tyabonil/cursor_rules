## 🚀 ENFORCEMENT CHECKLIST

### **Before Every Action:**
- [ ] Will this commit secrets? (LEVEL 1 - STOP if yes)
- [ ] Will this overwrite environment files? (LEVEL 1 - ASK if yes)
- [ ] Should I use MCP GitHub API instead of terminal git? (LEVEL 2 - YES)
- [ ] Is this work blocked and should be assigned? (LEVEL 2 - ASSIGN if yes)
- [ ] Is there an issue for this work? (LEVEL 2 - CREATE if no)

### **Before Every Merge:**
- [ ] Is test coverage 100% for new code? (LEVEL 3 - BLOCK if no)
- [ ] Is all Copilot feedback addressed? (LEVEL 3 - BLOCK if no)  
- [ ] Is PROJECT_CONTEXT.md updated? (LEVEL 3 - UPDATE if no)

### **Success Indicators:**
- ✅ 0 security incidents (Level 1 compliance)
- ✅ 0 workflow failures (Level 2 compliance)
- ✅ 100% quality gate passage (Level 3 compliance)
- ✅ Clean, maintainable codebase (Level 4 compliance)

## 📋 EMERGENCY OVERRIDE PROTOCOL

**ONLY for production-down emergencies:**
1. ✅ Explicit project owner approval required
2. ✅ Technical debt issues MUST be created immediately  
3. ✅ Quality fixes scheduled within 24 hours
4. ✅ Override reason documented in commit message

**NO OVERRIDES ALLOWED for Level 1 (Security) rules - EVER**
