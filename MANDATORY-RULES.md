# Mandatory Rules - Moved

> **This file has been moved to maintain backward compatibility**

The mandatory rules system has been integrated into vibe-codex. 

## For the latest rules:
- See the modular rule system in `lib/modules/`
- Or view the original rules in `legacy/cursor-rules/MANDATORY-RULES.md`

## To use vibe-codex:
```bash
npx vibe-codex init
```

This will install the appropriate rules and hooks for your project.
